**1.** A **repository** is like a folder where we can store  all the files, projects and can track the history of the file. We can discuss and manage our project's work by owner or whoever has the access to the repository by simply sharing ownership of repositories with other people in an organization. This repo is assigned for the `midterm project`. The project is about Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and has four data sets in the [`data`](https://github.com/sta518/first-midterm-annie5696/tree/master/data) folder of this repo. The primary data set is a subset of the `Global Terrorism Database (GTD)`, years 2013-2016. Two data sets deal with the population and poverty of U.S. cities. A fourth data set contains county information of U.S. cities.

   + On the first Landing pages of the repo, we can see the primary repo name on left top or in the URL after "/" ([github.com/**sta518**](https://github.com/sta518)), which has collection of all other reposiory.
